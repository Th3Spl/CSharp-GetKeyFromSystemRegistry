# CSharp-GetKeyFromSystemRegistry

### Th3Spl sill here!

Hello guys Th3Spl is still here and today i coded a very interesting Class in c # that can allow you to search for some key in the system registry 

### Requirements:
If you miss some librabry just search it and then download it with the NuGet visual studio 2019 system :)

<br>

1. Including the Class 
   ```C#
   Class1 commands = new Class1();
   ```
   
2. Calling a Function from the Class   
   ```C#
   commands.YourCommandFromTheClass();
   ``` 
<br>
### Suggestions: 

I can suggest to you to use Visual Studio 2019 and after you have created the project you can just press add an existing file then search for the unpacked file Class.cs
and then do the things wrote up there and you'll be able to use the library without any type of problem, if you have problem you can also contact me with discord that's always linked in my [`GitHub profile`](https://github.com/Th3Spl), i wish you a good code day :)
